/*
 * Info:
 * Dual-classed characters will detect only as their new class until their original class is re-activated, then they will detect as a multi-classed character.
 * Non-player classes (values strictly greater than 21) lack weapon slots (they have a single "attack" attack_button button instead), every other button is the same as a MAGE skillbar ⟹ mage_skillbar.
 * They have full access to activated item abilities, even those on weapons, just not the ability to switch weapons (or ammo).
 * The only exception is the WIZARD_EYE class — it has no skillbar buttons at all.
